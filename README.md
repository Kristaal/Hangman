# HANGMAN
(Developer: Kristina Orlichenko github: kristaal)

Hangman is a terminal based game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal Heroku.

Users try to guess a random word, by guessing the letters of the missing word. Each uncorrect guess takes one life. The game is over if the user guesses all the missing litters of the word or if he loses all his lives. Instructions are provided in the game to teach the user how to play.

## How to play

Hangman is a classic guessing game. You can read more about it on Wikipedia.
The length of the word is explicitly stated and is marked by underscores for each letter to be guessed.
The player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time.
If the player puts an incorrect letter, he will lose a try. The user continues to guess until they run out of lives without guessing the word.
